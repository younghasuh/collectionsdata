# Collections Data

This [shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) application provides a quick visualized summary of the specimen data for a collection. As long as the data is formatted correctly, you should be able to have your very own app that can be used to access your collections data. Check out this [LACM example](https://nhm-birds.shinyapps.io/lacm_birds/) to see what the script can do. I have this as a bookmark on my phone to quickly check what specimen types are lacking for an incoming specimen, or lookup relevant information from just catalog numbers.
